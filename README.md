# Lab: 37 - S3
- Is to allow users to upload files related to tasks, like screenshots or log files.

## Feature Tasks

### Uploads
- On the “Add a Task” activity, allow users to optionally select a file to attach to that task. If a user attaches a file to a task, that file should be uploaded to S3, and associated with that task.

### Displaying Files
- On the Task detail activity, if there is a file that is an image associated with a particular Task, that image should be displayed within that activity. (If the file is any other type, you should display a link to it.)
