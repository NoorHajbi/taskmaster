# Lab: 31 - Espresso and Polish
Is to add UI tests to the application, and polish any remaining feature tasks from previous labs.

## Feature Tasks
### 1. Espresso Testing
Add Espresso to the application, and use it to test basic functionality of the main components of the application.


- assert that important UI elements are displayed on the page
tap on a task, and assert that the resulting activity displays the name of that task
edit the userâ€™s username, and assert that it says the correct thing on the homepage


## Stretch Goals
Allow the user to specify on their settings page how many tasks should be shown on the homepage. Use this to dynamically display as many tasks as the user requests for display in the RecyclerView. Test this functionality using Espresso.
